# sum-of-sines-viewer

This is a fun little project using the [D3](https://d3js.org/) and
[Sliver](https://github.com/johnkerl/sliver) JavaScript libraries.

It gives you an opportunity to play around with superimposed sine waves.
You can control the amplitudes, frequencies, and phases, as well as the
sampling rate.

You can find the app hosted at [https://johnkerl.org/sum-of-sines-viewer](https://johnkerl.org/sum-of-sines-viewer).
